Tenzies Game --> You have to match the number in every block. You can freeze the blocks so that a new random number does not generate for them. Repeat this until all blocks have the same number.


Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
